# Shortform-Cooldown
A wellness app that helps users reduce excessive short-form social media usage without fully blocking access. The goal is to gently interrupt doom-scrolling loops while preserving user agency.

Select which apps you want to limit, and the mascot will remind you when you've been scrolling too long, across all apps.

Uses Screen Time activity monitoring to track usage across short-form apps.
